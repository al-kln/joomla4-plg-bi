# Bootstrap Icons for Joomla! CMS™

Free, high quality, open source icon library with over 1,500 icons. Include them anyway you like—SVGs, SVG sprite, or web fonts. Use them with or without Bootstrap in any project.

<a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Icons</a> are SVGs, so you can include them into your HTML in a few ways depending on how your project is setup. Bootstrap Icons include a width and height of 1em by default to allow for easy resizing via font-size.

To insert icons use the syntax <strong>{icon="xxx"}</strong>.

*This module is built for Joomla 4*
